    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sarma, commonly marketed in the English-speaking world as stuffed grape leaves, stuffed vine leaves, or stuffed cabbage leaves, is a food in Southeastern European and Ottoman cuisine made of vegetable leaves rolled around a filling of grains (such as rice), minced meat, or both. The vegetable leaves may be cabbage, patience dock, collard, grapevine, kale or chard leaves.</p>
    <p>In Serbia, a vegetarian version of stuffed cabbage rolls is one of the dishes that can be eaten during the observance of Lent and on Christmas Eve. These vegetarian sarma can be composed of rice, onions, potatoes, walnuts, spices, and fermented cabbage leaves (sauerkraut) as the wrap of the sarma. There is also the classic form that has minced meat which could be pork or beef. In the winter sauerkraut leaves are utilized to wrap the rest of the ingredients to make a sarma. During the spring and summertime there is a replacement of the sauerkraut with grapevine leaves. Grapevine leaves are used during the summer as they are easier to use than sauerkraut which is usually made in the winter. In Serbia, sarma are the first appetizers at celebrations such as the slavas.</p>
